# canvas-game
A simple game I'm making in canvas.
Ok, this is my first time using github, so I have no clue how readmes work. 
It's an html file.
Double click it

Please tell me what to do on these I need help.
Ummmm
You can change the background.jpeg file to whatever you want for a custom background?
I really don't know what to write here!
